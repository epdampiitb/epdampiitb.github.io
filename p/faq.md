<b><i>Where can I find the BTech/DD curriculum?</i></b>

The current BTech/DD curriculum of Engineering Physics (last updated November 2020) can be found [here](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/en/current-students/resources).

<b><i>What if there’s a slot clash of a core course with an elective that I want to take?</b></i>

The DGSec floats a form of electives so that batches can get courses in slots which are prefered by most of the students of that batch.
If even after this there’s quite a good number of students (say around 15) who want to take a course but there’s a slot clash, your CR can talk to the concerned prof and request him/her to change the slot to one of your prefered slots (if other registered students don’t have any pains).

<b><i>After registration I’m getting this message: Instructor Consent Required. What should I do?</i></b>

Check if you have registered for a course in which you haven’t done the pre-requisite courses. If you have, contact the Instructor (some Instructors do this intentionally). 
If none of the above cases then there might be some bug regarding that course. Contact asc in that case.

<b><i>How many credits can I register for, in a sem?</i></b>

The total number of credits you can register for depends on the category you belong to.
Category I : 54 (CPI >=8 and no backlogs)
Category II : 48 (Registered for >= 18 credits in last 2 sems and no backlogs
Category III : 48 (Only 1 backlog and earned >= 18 credits  in each sem)
Category IV : 36 ( >1 backlog in last 2 sem and earned >= 18 credits  in each sem)
Category V : 30 (Earned < 18 credits  in last 2 sems)
You need to talk to your FacAd if you want to overload yourself.

<b><i>How do I know if some non-core course can be re-tagged as Department Elective or Institute Elective later during retagging?</b></i>

If tagging rules are followed, you don’t need instructor consent for retagging. 
Courses of almost all departments except ENT, IDC & MG can easily be tagged as Institute elective. For ENT/IDC/MG courses you need to ask the Prof. of that course if he allows you to tag the course as Institute elective.
Instead of 2 6 credit courses for institute electives, you can do 8 credit courses too. Just the total should be >= 12 credits.

			<h2>Minor:</h2>
		<!--/header-->

<b><i>What is a minor? How would pursuing a minor help me?</i></b>

Minor is an additional degree a student will earn if he/she does 30 credits worth of additional learning in a discipline other than his/her major discipline of B.Tech/DD/Int. For example, if you are interested in pursuing research in theoretical physics, a Math Minor might be of interest to you.

<b><i>Who is eligible to pursue a minor?</i></b>

The following students can register for minor courses every semester:
B.Techs / Int. M.Sc : Any B.Tech/Int. M.Sc.: Student with Academic Standing – Category I, II and III.
DDs : Category I

<b><i>Can I choose any courses in a dept. for a minor?</i></b>

No. You will have to choose from the list of courses prescribed by the dept.

<b><i>Can I take 2 minors?</i></b>

Yes, if your faculty-advisor permits and if you can find the slots to do so. There is also provision of having 6 to 12 credits of minor as a project in some departments.

<b><i>How is the allotment done?</i></b>

The allotment of minors (due to limited seats) is done on the basis of Core CPI after taking students’ preferences.

<b><i>Does the Minor grade affect my SPI/CPI?</i></b>

No. When you complete your minor, a Minor CPI will reflect on your transcript. 

<b><i>If I get an FR Grade in a minor course do I need to repeat the course? And will it reflect in my final transcript?</i></b>

No, you do not need to repeat the course. However, an ‘FR’ grade in the course will reflect under the additional courses done.

			<h2>Honours:</h2>
		<!--/header-->

<b><i>What is an honor? Why should I do it?</i></b>

For Btech students:<br>
Honor is an additional credential a student will earn if he/she opts for the extra 24 credits needed for this in his/her own discipline. The concerned department specifies the course requirements for earning the Honors. An honor is exactly like a minor except that all honor courses are of the same dept.
Honor courses are either advanced level courses in your discipline, or are courses designed to give you more exposure to different areas of your discipline. On successful accumulation of credits at the end of the programme, this will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx, with Honors.” The fact will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses, etc., taken.

<b><i>Does the Honors grade affect my CPI or is it just like the minor?</i></b>

Just like minor, when you complete an honor, an Honor CPI will reflect in the final transcript. If one has done some of the honor courses but not enough to acquire a honor degree, then those courses would be counted in Additional learning CPI. (for DDs, compulsory honors courses will affect their Core CPI)

<b><i>Can I do both a minor and honor?</i></b>

Yes, if your CPI > 8 (with no backlogs). Depends on your FacAd too, if you are overloading the number of credits.

<b><i>Can I choose any course in the dept. as an Honor course?</i></b>

No. You will have to choose from the list of courses provided by the Department. 

<b><i>What are the other types of tags and how are they different from each other?</i></b>

Institute Elective – Courses other than that from your dept.
Open Elective – Courses from any dept. (including yours)
Dept. Elective –  Courses from your dept. (a list is there on asc for the same). Other than SLP and courses that have similar content as your core courses, all others can be tagged as dept electives. 
Additional Learning Course – Courses from any dept. (including yours) Not counted in Core CPI
Audit – Courses from any dept. (including yours) Not counted in Core CPI (non-credit courses with only AU and NP grades)
Sit-Through – Courses from any dept. for which you do not register but attend classes due to interest with the permission of the instructor.
