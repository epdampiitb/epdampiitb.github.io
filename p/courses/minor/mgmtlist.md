<h2>Review by Kanishk Modi</h2>
<h3>Motivation for undertaking minor</h3>
<p>Interest in Finance and Management. Non-core advantage</p>
<h3>Overview of Minor</h3>
<p>Usually, it's pretty chill. Might have attendance and course projects. There is a normally high CPI cut off especially for Accounts and Finance. You have to start in 3rd semester if you wish to finish the Minor.</p>

<h3>Courses Undertaken</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><h4>MA405 : Project Management
			<br>Taken by Prof. Gajendra K. Adil (2022-23 Spring)</h4>
			<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
			<p>None</p>
			<h5>Course Content</h5>
			<p></p>
			<h5>Grading Scheme</h5>
			<p>
			</p>
			<h5>Overview</h5>
			<p>Mini-quiz almost every week with little slack. Assessment in general was very extensive. Midsems and Endsems were a bit difficult. Course Project is fine if you have good teamwork. If you are regular with stuff, you can get good grades.</p>
