			<h3>PH 534: Quantum Information and Computing
             <br> Prof. Himadri Dhar</h3>
		</header>

<h4> Prerequisite</h4>
<p>Knowing QM1 either formally or informally beforehand is useful (mainly Dirac bra-ket notation) but not a strict prerequisite. But, about 50% of the people who took the course did not already know this, so don't worry about it too much, the prof teaches it in the first few lectures.</p>

<h4> Course Content</h4>
<p>Basic postulates of quantum mechanics, density matrix formalism, measures of quantum and classical information, holevo bound, measures of entanglement, Quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation and communication, quantum cryptography</p>

<h4> Books</h4>
<p>Nielsen and Chuang</p>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Some lectures were online and some later lectures were live. Live lectures were certainly more engaging. The prof made an effort to teach in a way so that there was something for everyone from complete noobs to people well versed in the subject

</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>There were 2 quizzes, a midsem, an endsem and an assignment. Quizzes and midsem were relatively very easy and a large fraction of the class got full marks (but note that grading was relative!) The assignment had a long deadline, and had very tough problems (including a few that needed help from software for matrix eigenvalues and plotting etc). The endsem was also challenging but doable (and did not require/allow software).  <br>

</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>Don't shy away from this course just because you know nothing about QC beforehand, it is (and is meant to be) an introductory course!  </p>
