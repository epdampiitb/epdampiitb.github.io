			<h3>PH 567: Non Linear Dynamics.
                </h3>
		</header>
<h3>Review by Anonymous
<br />Taken by Prof. Amitabha Nandi</h3>
<h4> Prerequisite</h4>
<p>Calculus, Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations</p>

<h4> Course Content</h4>
<p>1D and 2D systems, Index theory, Limit cycles, Bifurcations, Lorenz and Rossler systems, Chaos theory, Fractals, Logistic map and Universality, Renormalization Group flows, Invariant measures</p>

<h4> Books</h4>
<p>"1. Non Linear Dynamics and Chaos - Steven H. Strogatz (Main reference)
2. Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers - Robert. C. Hilborn
3. Deterministic Chaos - H.G Schuster and W. Just"</p>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>"Since it was an online semester, the lectures were recorded and uploaded in Moodle. There were additional weekly interaction sessions with the instructor, where he would revise the concepts, solve doubts and discuss problems. However, due to declining attendance in the live sessions, the policy of uploading recorded lectures was dropped towards the end of the course and the remaining lectures were conducted live. <br />

The lecture content closely followed the book by Strogatz and the explanations were clear with sufficient rigour. Lecture notes were provided along with the uploaded lectures. The live sessions were fun and interactive, and the professor was very enthusiastic during the discussions. "</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>"Problem sets were provided, but there were ungraded. <br />

There were weekly lecture quizzes (10%), short quizzes (20%), group project (20%), midsem (20%) and endsem (30%). <br />

For the group project, a research paper based on particular topic(s) related to the course content was allotted to each group. The groups had to present the results of the papers and also submit a project report. <br />

The questions asked in exams (quizzes, midsem and endsem) required critical thinking and a thorough understanding of the course content to solve them. Solving problems from the problem sets and Strogatz certainly gives an edge in attempting the exams.<br />

The grading was standard with a large number of ABs and BBs. However, only 2 AAs were awarded, which isn't surprising. "</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>Keeping up to date with the lectures is essential since a diverse set of topics are covered. Reading Strogatz and solving problems from the problem sets definitely helps. </p>

<h3>Review by Arnav Jain
<br />Taken by Prof.Punit Parmananda (2023-24 Autumn)</h3>

<h4>Prerequisite</h4>
<p>None</p>

<h4>Feedback on Lectures</h4>
<p>The most popular course for those eager to jump into physics electives in their third semester, as it has no pre requisites. The course is slow paced, and had a presentation on any topic related to non linear dynamics as a course project. The course is also very broad; applications of non linear dynamics extend outside physics into a lot of places, basically any system which has a non linear differential equation modelling it; it matters not whether that equation is being applied to something in finance, biology, or physics.<br />
Lectures were slow but interactive. Professor took time to ensure everyone understood the concepts. There was an additional two lectures in the end of the course on experimental methods in non linear dynamics, which was a bit rushed and had no easy resources to find and study; take notes whenever that comes up, as the final exam consists of a good number of questions from it. </p>

<h4>Grading Scheme</h4>
<p>There was one midsemester, one endsemester, and a presentation on any topic of non linear dynamics post midsemester. The exams were average in difficulty. The grading is good, but it is not easy to get an AA in this.</p>

<h4>Follow-up courses</h4>

<h3>Review by Yashowardhan Rai
<br />Taken by Prof.Punit Parmananda (2023-24 Autumn)</h3>

<h4>Prerequisite</h4>
<p>None</p>

<h4>Feedback on Lectures</h4>
<p> My experience with this course was very enjoyable. Punit sir leads a very discussion oriented and impactful class every time and his personality makes sure you won't get bored in the class at all.<br /> 

Non linear dynamics is a very interesting field with tons of mind bending realisations awaiting you, at this stage this is one of the best courses a physics or even maths lover can take. I was very fulfilled learning what I did from this course. <br />

The group project will force you to think hard and getting the practice of presenting is always good. The midsem and endsem have some standard questions which can be practiced beforehand however a good conceptual understanding directly linked to concepts in lectures is required to score well. No extra practice is required as such other than being an active part of the class.</p>

<h4>Grading Scheme</h4>
<p>10% attendance ( 1 mark for 10 random days he decides to take attendance ), 20% group project, 30% midsem, 40%midsem</p>

<h4>Additional tips/comments</h4>
<p>Watch the lectures on non-Linear dynamics by steven strogatz and go through his book on the same if you have time, will make your understanding more crystallized.<br /> 

Obtain practice problems and do them before the exam, not as much effort is required compared to core courses but doing this is definitely recommended.<br /> 

Interact with punit sir, ask questions. It is a rare opportunity to have so much open discussion with a professor.</p>

<h3>Review by Kanishk Modi
<br />Taken by Prof.Punit Parmananda (2023-24 Autumn)</h3>

<h4>Prerequisite</h4>
<p>None</p>

<h4>Feedback on Lectures</h4>
<p>I wanted to explore a new field and the Professor was said to be very fun. The courses is one of the chillest honors level course and pretty immersive.
You wouldn't wanna miss it :) <br /> Everything was covered and slides shared. You don't need to study a day if you attend all lectures properly. I didn't study a single day and got an AA because I attended all lectures sincerely.</p>

<h4>Grading Scheme</h4>
<p>Only Midsems, Endsems and Course project. Course project should be fun if you want it to be. Exams were all open notes, could print all slides and take them as well.</p>

<h4>Additional tips/comments</h4>
