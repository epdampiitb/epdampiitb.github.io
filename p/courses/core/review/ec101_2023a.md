<h3> Review by Anonymous </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Slides were not super coherent and easy to understand. You could still memorise the contents and do well in the exam, but the capacity to do that depends on the person.</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>There were 2 quizzes (10% each) apart from the midsem and endsem(40% each. Macro – Midsem, Micro – Endsem). Micro and Macro prof.s had a different style of evaluation from each other. In the first half sem (Macro), the quizzes had negative marking, but in 2nd half, there were just a lot more questions with more memorization required and also attention to what was taught in class, because there was at least some thing in the Micro exam which wasn't there in the slides (prof. dependent). Attendance had no marks. Grading took place separately for all divisions. They had different prof.s and also slightly different curricula (though, they were same for the most part). No cheat sheets were allowed in the exam, as this course was mostly about memorisation.
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>"Principles of Economics" by Gregory N. Mankiw (for Macro). 
"Samuelson Paul A, William D. Nordhaus" , Economics (for Micro). 
Preferably read the book little by little, on a regular basis.</p>
