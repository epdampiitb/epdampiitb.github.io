<h3> Review by Anonymous </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Aside from the content on ASC, Hridid sir  

Planned to cover Topology in CMP, which is a new 

Emerging field in condensed matter research area. 

Although we couldn't cover it, unlike the senior batch, 

The idea seemed cool to me.
</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>3 x 10% quizzes 

50% Endsem 

10% Project (nothing complicated) 

10% Tutorial attendance
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>
New topic and ideas 
Problems may not be straightforwardAttend lectures regularly. CMP is an entirely new topic, compared to the previous courses. So it may get a little difficult to keep up with the course content.  
Solve assignments/ problem sets/ tutorials regularly. The theory becomes clear after a point, but using it in solving problem is a next challenge.

<h3> Review by Anonymous </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Topics on ASC + introduction to topology (we could not cover it)
</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>3 quizzes of 10 marks each 

5 tutorial sessions for total of 10 marks 

1 group presentation for 10 marks 

Endsem for 50 marks
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>
Concepts build up so it's good to attend lectures regularly 
Tutorial sessions are worth attending 
50% weightage for endsem felt too much (although endsem turned out to be relatively easy) so negotiate it with the professor if needed
