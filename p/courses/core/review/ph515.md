			<h3>PH 515: Introduction to Atomic and Molecular Physics
             <br>Prof B.N Jagatap</h3>
		</header>

<h4> Prerequisite</h4>
<p>QM I, QM II, EM</p>

<h4> Course Content</h4>
<p>"Review of hydrogen atom and relativistic effects(spin orbit, mass-velocity and Darwin terms)  Lamb shift, Rydberg levels, Spectroscopy: Transition probabilities and cross-sections, Lifetime, Line broadening mechanisms, Homogenous and in-homogenous broadening. Many electron atoms, L-S and j-j coupling schemes, Selection rules, Zeeman and Paschen-Back effects, Hyperfine interaction (magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions), Isotope shift (mass shift and volume shift). 

Molecular structure: Rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom, Rotational-vibrational spectrum of diatomic molecules, Electronic structure of diatomic molecules and extension to simple polyatomic molecules, Selection rules for rotational, vibrational and electronic transitions,

Cooling and trapping of atoms/ions with lasers."</p>

<h4> Books</h4>
<p>Not required</p>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>The lecture notes were brilliant and comprehensive, you don't need to look further even if you want to get perfect scores in exams.</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
