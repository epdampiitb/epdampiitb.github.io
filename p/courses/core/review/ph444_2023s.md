<h3> Review by Anonymous </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Course is mathematically heavy with lots of lengthy derivations which you 
are supposed to remember for the exams</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>2 Quiz 15% 
Midsem 20% 
Quiz 15% 
Endsem 30% 
Project 20%
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>Work out the derivation before the exams (as is the case with Photonics)  
We mostly used Jackson (and for some parts Griffiths was used)</p>

<h3> Review by Anonymous </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Lectures were quite interactive - he used chalk and board for the most part, and sometimes additional slides for some concepts. Almost all the derivations were covered in class in detail. Attendance was not compulsory. </p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>2 quizzes (30%) 
Midsem (20%) 
Endsem (35%) 
Group project (20%) 

Questions in most exams were slight modifications of tutorial problems - there were two or three challenging problems in the entire duration of the course. Each exam was worth 100 points which was scaled down appropriately. Endsem was quite lengthy but the grading was good (17 AAs in a class of ~65).
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>The course is quite interesting in terms of the content covered and the instructor was also understanding. The project was, however, worth a lot less than the effort it required. Be prepared for some tensor algebra, and quite a lot of algebra in general. </p>
