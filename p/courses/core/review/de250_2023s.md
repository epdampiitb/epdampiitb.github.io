<h4> Prerequisite</h4>
<p>None</p>

<h4>Feedback on Lectures</h4>
<p>It is one of the courses that can get you thinking as to why am i doing this. The labs range from chill, to slightly hectic. Overall it would have been chill, if not for the extra lab course it brings in. Lecture videos are online, so those are easy to run through. There is not much that needs to be done outside labs, unless you want to give high effort in this course. If you like it, more the power to you. 
The course consists of various problem statements related to the campus, and runs through the design process of how to ideate, decide, design, and prototype a potential solution for it. In theory this sounds interesting, and if you like your problem statement you can even have fun in the course thinking and designing. One thing i definitely took from the course is how even little things need to be designed and tested before it is set to use. </p>

<h4> Feedback on course evaluation</h4>
<p>Grading was easy. Be sure to do the safe app attendance, and be present in every lab. one endsemester presentation of final product designed, and a midsemester pitch of your solution. The exact weightage is a bit convoluted but is told beforehand on moodle. Grading was very chill.</p>

<h4>Final Takeaways</h4>
<p>Do the safe app attendance for sure. <p>
