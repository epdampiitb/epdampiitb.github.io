		</header>

<h4> Prerequisite</h4>
<p>No formal pre requisites.</p>

<h4> Course Content</h4>
<p>SSP: <br>
1. g value using ESR spectrometer,<br>
2. spin-lattice relaxation time using NMR spectrometer,<br>
3. energy gap of a semiconductor using four-probe method,<br>
4. carrier concentration using Hall measurement<br><br>
NP: <br>
1. Absorption coefficient of gamma-rays in Aluminium.<br>
2. Low and high counting statistics using G. M. Counter.<br>
3. Gamma-ray spectrometry using NaI(Tl) scintillator.<br>
4. Compton scattering of gamma-ray using 137Cs source.<br>
5. Coincident study of annihilation photons using 22Na source.<br>
6. Rutherford scattering of alpha particles in gold.</p>

<h4> Books</h4>
<p>No reference book as such, lab manual and any material that instructors share prior to experiment is good enough</p>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Not required.</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>In online mode, lab sessions were limited to analyzing the data provided by the instructors and estimating the results. Endsem was theory based with few questions that involved analyzing the data that was provided to us</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>This could be an interesting course in offline, some experiments seems genuinely fun, no tips as such as we did the course in online mode which is way different from how its actually done.</p>
