<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>N.A.</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>I will start with labeling "GPL as the chillest course in our 4th semester". The experiments were interesting and i had enjoyed each lab. Although if had been grouped in 4 so there were times where there wasn't much to do on, so one might not learn as effectively as one would have if the experiments were had to be on his/her own or in a group of 2. 
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p> Course was good, apparatus were cool and grading was great :)
