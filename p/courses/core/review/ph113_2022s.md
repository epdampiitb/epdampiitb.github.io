<h3> Review by Gurupoorna </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Moderate level of difficulty. Since it was a half-semester course in just the 2nd semester, the professor did not involve too much mathematical jargon into it.  

 There were weekly assignments including good questions, some of which were also discussed in tutorial classes, conducted by the professor herself. Requires a bit of practice in solving those questions.  

 The course was very interesting and much rather beautiful.</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>Two quizzes, a midsemester and an endsemester. The endsemester has a higher weightage than most theory courses. The exams contain all variety of questions, from easy to tricky. However, they do tend to be lengthy. Grading was average.
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>Moderate understanding of differential equations and linear algebra will guide better in concepts and lets you appreciate the subject.  

 Resources that I used was Waves notes by David Morin.</p>
