<h3> Review by Anonymous </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Lectures were fairly simple to understand. The professor was interactive and encouraged doubts and discussions. Although synchronisation of topics could have been done better. The mathematics was not difficult although it takes time to understand the new formalism. Overall it is a straightforward course that covers the introductory topics of quantum mechanics </p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>2 Quizzes: 30% weightage
Misdesm : 30%
Endsem: 40%
Level of each examination was easy to moderate. Midsem and endsem included both objective and subjective questions. Marking scheme was quite lenient
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>Overall it is an introductory course, covering the basic concepts and formalism of quantum mechanics. Attending the lectures will help in being on track. Doing PYQ's before exams will be very helpful</p>
