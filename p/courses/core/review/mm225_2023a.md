<h3> Review by Anonymous </h3>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>The biggest trouble was that after just one semester of a coding course (CS101) , everyone was expected to be good enough at coding to be able to tackle the labs without issue. After a couple of labs, they would just provide the problem name and students would have to prepare what they could, given the name of the topic. 
 

The course wasn't well organized and well taught at all as it was put together in a very short amount of time. Frequent reliance on online resources for understanding course content was necessary. Content (particularly of first half sem) was nearly impossible to understand from the slides and pretty difficult to understand from the books)</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>Weekly Labs (30%), two quizzes (15% each), Midsem (15%), Endsem (40% (full syllabus)). Each question carried very little individual weightage up until Endsem (where each question was worth 5% of the total, and there were 8 questions). There was no attendance. 

Though it must be kept in mind that there might be a significant difference between the new AI/DS course and MM225 – The professors will be different and the course won't take place in an LA with multiple departments.
</p>

<h4> Tips</h4>
<p>"Introduction to Probability" by Grinstead and Snell (first half sem) 
"Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists" by Sheldon M. Ross (second half sem) 
Truthfully speaking, these books aren't particularly useful either. They were just the source material. Online resources(like videos), even Wikipedia, were much better most of the time.</p>
