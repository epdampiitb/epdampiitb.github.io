			<h2>PH 444: Digital Electronics and Microprocessors (2023) Spring
             <br>Prof Maniraj Mahalingam</h2>
		</header>

<h4> Prerequisite</h4>
<p>None</p>

<h4> Course Content</h4>
<p>Digital electronics: Theory includes (1) Boolean algebra Basic gates (2) Combinational logic (3) Sequential logic (4) Finite State Machines (5) Karnaugh maps. Laboratory: Each of the theory topics is developed in a lab assignment Microprocessors: (1) Architecture of microprocessors, with focus on the hardware design and application to control of physics experiments (2) Digital input/output systems (3) analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion (4) Interrupts. Each of these concepts is developed using laboratory assignments on the Arduino microcontroller platform. Course project: Culminates in a student ideated project that combines concepts of digital electronics and microprocessors to build an electronic instrumentation system that demonstrates some physics concept, or is useful for a research experiment.</p>

<h4>Lectures</h4>
<p>Lectures are not useful. However, do read them up before the theory exam, as the grading can be pedantic about the notation and the way the solution has been presented. The labs for the digital part are LONG. It is very useful to have a good practice of building circuits up, so get as much of that as you can in Analog. However, most of the weightage in the end boils down to the endsemester lab and project. Try to get the project done well. Do not leave it for the very end. Playing around with Arduino is very fun, and it is always exciting to see what all cool stuff everyone came up with!
The course is a mix of 16 credits our seniors used to have into 6; naturally there is going to something rushed, and brushed under the carpet. Labs are long and often extend past time, and are stressful too; so the first half of the course is a bit of a pain. Once microprocessor starts, it is good.</p>

<h4> Assignments, Exams and Grading</h4>
<p>There are a lot of things done to the point few, if at all anyone will be aware about the exact weightage. There were labs, moodle quizzes, midsemester theory, endsemester lab, project; overall very convoluted, but the major weight goes to the endsemester lab and the project. Despite all the issues the course has, the grading was atleast nice.
