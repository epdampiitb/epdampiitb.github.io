<h3>Review by Agnipratim Nag</h3>

<h4>Why TAship?</h4>
<p>Really wanted to experience what its like to teach + stipend :)</p>

<h4>Who should go for TAship?</h4>
<p>Anyone who feels that they really understanding something well and would like to convey that understanding to others in a simple, effective way</p>

<h4>Courses TA'd for</h4>
<p>MA 109<br>MA 111<br> CS 228<br> PH 111<br> PH 110</p>

<h4>Commitments</h4>
<p>1 tut a week + preparing for it = 1hr + 1-2hrs a week (approx), can be more during paper correction or if youâ€™re enthu to make slides to make the learning experience more fun for your tutees (i made slides, can check them out on my <a href = "https://agnipratimnag.github.io/teaching/">site</a> )</p>

<h4>Overall Experience</h4>
<p>I have TA-ed for maths dept and physics,  compared to physics in terms of the course content, but it's easier because they don't expect you to check papers. I would suggest if you are interested in abstract math then it wouldn't be too tough</p>
