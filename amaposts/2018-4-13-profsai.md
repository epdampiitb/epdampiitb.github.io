Research Interests:

I am interested in understanding quantum physics and applying it to future quantum technologies. Though many of you have heard of quantum computers, the areas of future technology where quantum mechanics can make a difference are numerous. What physicists are doing now in this emergent technology area is to chalk out what the physics of these devices should be such that they outperform their classical counterparts.

I divide this research interest into three broad areas <i>[(Read More)](https://epdampiitb.github.io/p/kaleidoscope/ama/1.html)</i>
